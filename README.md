# Amazon.in-Clone
Amazon.in clone using HTML and CSS

The Amazon Clone project is a front-end web development project that replicates the user interface of Amazon.in, one of the largest e-commerce websites. Built entirely using HTML and CSS, this project aims to demonstrate fundamental web design skills and a strong understanding of layout structures, styling techniques, and responsive design principles.

Key Features:
  A visually appealing header with Amazonâ€™s logo, a search bar, and navigation links.
  A functional product grid showcasing featured items and categories.
  Fully styled banners for promotions and offers.
  Grid or flexbox layout to display products with images, titles, prices, and rating icons.
  Hover effects for buttons like "Add to Cart" or "View Details."
Technologies Used:
HTML5: To structure the content and elements on the webpage.
CSS3: To style the page, implement colors, layouts, animations, and responsive design.
Objective:
The main goal of this project is to replicate the aesthetic and structure of Amazon.in using only HTML and CSS. This project serves as an excellent exercise in building a real-world interface without the use of JavaScript or backend functionality, focusing solely on the visual and structural aspects of the web page.

Limitations:
No backend functionality (e.g., no working search bar or shopping cart).
Static content; no dynamic interactions like filters or live updates.
